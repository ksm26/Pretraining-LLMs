# 🧠 [Pretraining LLMs](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/pretraining-llms/)

Welcome to the "Pretraining LLMs" course! 🧑‍🏫 The course dives into the essential steps of pretraining large language models (LLMs).

## 📘 Course Summary
In this course, you’ll explore pretraining, the foundational step in training LLMs, which involves teaching an LLM to predict the next token using vast text datasets. 

🧠 You'll learn the essential steps to pretrain an LLM, understand the associated costs, and discover cost-effective methods by leveraging smaller, existing open-source models.

**Detailed Learning Outcomes:**
1. 🧠 **Pretraining Basics**: Understand the scenarios where pretraining is the optimal choice for model performance. Compare text generation across different versions of the same model to grasp the performance differences between base, fine-tuned, and specialized pre-trained models.
2. 🗃️ **Creating High-Quality Datasets**: Learn how to create and clean a high-quality training dataset using web text and existing datasets, and how to package this data for use with the Hugging Face library.
3. 🔧 **Model Configuration**: Explore ways to configure and initialize a model for training, including modifying Meta’s Llama models and initializing weights either randomly or from other models.
4. 🚀 **Executing Training Runs**: Learn how to configure and execute a training run to train your own model effectively.
5. 📊 **Performance Assessment**: Assess your trained model’s performance and explore common evaluation strategies for LLMs, including benchmark tasks used to compare different models’ performance.

## 🔑 Key Points
- 🧩 **Pretraining Process**: Gain in-depth knowledge of the steps to pretrain an LLM, from data preparation to model configuration and performance assessment.
- 🏗️ **Model Architecture Configuration**: Explore various options for configuring your model’s architecture, including modifying Meta’s Llama models and innovative pretraining techniques like Depth Upscaling, which can reduce training costs by up to 70%.
- 🛠️ **Practical Implementation**: Learn how to pretrain a model from scratch and continue the pretraining process on your own data using existing pre-trained models.
